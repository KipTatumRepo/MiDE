Campus Re-Org Mitigation Decision Engine <br />
I am working on the database for this program

This was my third major project after my internship.  This was interesting because of algorithm we came up with to base the application on.<br />
What this program does is take in inputs from the user from various comboboxes, and generate a list of suggested mitigations to help keep customers happy.<br />
When the program was tested by experienced cafe operators and SLT the list of mitigations suggested by the application were what the 
operators would have done.
